## PLANNING

### Oracles

- I have come across a similar App that tracks finances.
- I explored the app to learn what the product can for me and others. (There is a lot of claim on what the product can do.)

### RISK ANALYSIS

- It might not be clear on how to get started
- There's a bug that stops me from doing what I should be able to do.
- Too many numbers input hanging or crashing the App.
- Assigning random numbers to Categories not used.

## Heuristics

- Goldilocks
- 0,1, Many

### Questions

- How does a user sign up?
- How easy is it to get started? (As I explore I would capture thoughts about how easy it is to get started)
- How do I input figures in the App? How do I create my categories and edit default categories in the App.

### Setup

- Download the App and open.

# CHARTERS

### Explore entering daily expenses to discover how it works.

- At first, the red message suggests entry expenses. I thought it would be income.
- No option to sort my expense record by time of entry. So, facing difficulty to recall my reason and moments of expense.
- Income and Expenses both are the same color "Green". I think "Expenses" will be Red.
- I don't know, suddenly there is an icon (. . .), where this icon comes from. I've clicked, but it's not taking any entry.
- Amount entered for all categories but one option is not getting linked between chart and prices
- I don't find the "Toiletry" icon, which is my last entry.
- "Communications" is less than the other 13 categories, Entry 2 small "Communications" entry one after another. But still "communications" icon not showing on the home screen.
- In the moments of a record entry, if I make any wrong note and click "Choose Category" then I don't have any options to back and edit my wrong note.
- If balance is "0.00" then Balance field should be "RED" color. But it appears Green.

### Explore entering daily income to discover how it works.

- I try to add mobile wallet/Online money, but no option to add it. By default, only Cash and Payment card.
- Time of entry is not shown on the screen.
- Unable to filter entry by Money type(Cash or Payment card).
- Try to edit my income entry by just one digit (from 27565.57 to 27665.57) change in the middle digit, not working.
- Plus(+) and cancel(X) button when entering a new income seems to be blurry.

### Explore search functionality to discover how it works.

- Search records should be close if I tap outside of the search popup or swap up of the mobile screen. But it's not too close.
  (Such as, Categories, Account, Currencies, Settings sections if close if I tap or swap)
- Search for "Room rent" and click the suggestion. But it appears other irrelevant records too.
- If I search expense/income then the result is empty. It should appear all of my expenses/income.
- If I search Mastercard then the result is not suggesting anything. Also, search result for Master card shows records that are not made by Mastercard.

### Explore installing the App to discover how it works.

##### _Objective : New user installs and opens the app for the first time._

- After downloading the App, I could not slide to the next page normally this should be the case. I needed to always click on 'GET STARTED'/ '. . .' button, considering I have a big thumb, clicking on the '. . .' was not a good user experience. How about adding a normal slide flow just by clicking on any place on the screen.
- "ONLY RIGHT NOW" seems like a button which offer more.
- "127k+ reviews" doesn't have any deep linking to open about app review.
- "RESTORE" doesn't have any link
- On clicking "CLAIM MY OFFER" the internet goes off and an "Unknown error" appears.
- Opening the App for the first time, I move through the first onboarding slide and kill the App, when re opened it take me straight to the main page. Should it not take me back to the on boarding slider screen?

### Explore settings to discover how it works.

- On clicking 'Restore Data' notification is appearing in the bottom of the screen not at the bottom.
- Font pop up is not consistent as entire app when I click on "About Monefy" in settings.

# Findings from my charters.

- I think it would be better if all expenses (icons, texts) are only RED color, or it would be helpful if there is an option to change the color or text and icons.
- There are no help options in the app to learn about it.
- I feel confused about icons and categories.
- The entry does not have any 'time of entry' and does not have any option to filter by time, which is very important.
- Thers is no section to signup. The feel of personalization should exist in a App.

Afterward, I feel that the Monefy app fulfills all major demands.

# Did everything work as expected?

The main features are working as expected.

- It's easy to entry. Expenses and income buttons are very easy for quick entry.
- App was not crashing and hanging.
- The records are user-friendly to sort by day, week, month, etc.
- Search can find any records.
- I can set up monthly budget.
- I can add any type of payment method.
- Very quickly I can transfer money from one payment method to another payment method.

# What bugs were discovered?

Found some bugs, but I'm confused, whether some of these are features or not. Those are already included in the Exploratory testing charters.

# Prioritization of charters.

Expense area of the "Monefy" app I've tested first. This is because in our daily life our expenses are more important than income. User mainly use this app because they want to control their money outflow. Everyone wants to know precise details of their cost control data. Where cost control focusses on both the big picture and the smaller details, expense control makes immediate changes to spending habits.

# Time planned for each Exploratory testing charters:

1. Entry daily expenses. Time: 360min
2. Entry daily income. Time: 300min
3. Search. Time: 240min
4. Explore setting area Time: 120min
5. Install app first time. Time:120min

# Risks to mitigate for this type of application.

I will create a "Risk Mitigation Checklist" and prioritize the risk. Also, ensure that these identified risks are valid. Afterwards, create a plan, monitor it, and solve it.
Data security is at the top of the list in this case.
